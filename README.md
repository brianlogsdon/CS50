# CS50
CS50 is an online computer science course offered by Harvard University through edx.org.
I took this course to get a solid foundation of computer science fundamentals before I took my web developer bootcamp, and would highly recommend it to anyone else in that same position. 

# Topics Covered
* A broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming
* How to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently
* Concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development
* Familiarity in a number of languages, including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML
* How to engage with a vibrant community of like-minded learners from all levels of experience
* How to develop and present a final programming project to your peer
